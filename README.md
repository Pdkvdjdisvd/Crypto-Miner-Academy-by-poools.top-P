Crypto Miner Academy by poools.top - is an educational game in Telegram where players can dive into the realistic world of cryptocurrency mining. The game offers both a theoretical foundation, covering key aspects of mining, and practical experience in managing a mining business, closely reflecting real-world scenarios.
Players will have access only to ASIC equipment, aligning with current mining standards. Profitability in the game is influenced by various factors, such as the power and efficiency of the equipment, network difficulty, and the constantly fluctuating price of Bitcoin. Additionally, players must consider costs related to electricity, maintenance, employee wages, as well as potential equipment breakdowns and delivery issues.
To purchase their first piece of equipment, players will need to earn in-game currency by following the projectâ€™s social media channels and those of its partners. As time progresses, the cost of equipment will increase, making the game more challenging and requiring players to develop more strategic approaches.
In addition, players have a unique opportunity to earn real money by connecting real equipment to Pools.top. In the future, an NFT collection on the TON blockchain is planned, tied to real mining equipment, allowing players to earn income in BTC.

This game, with its realistic mechanisms, offers players a comprehensive experience of managing a mining business, blending entertainment with education in the field of cryptocurrencies.
